## Introduction
Capybara starts a browser. This can be a real browser (Firefox via selenium-webdriver) or headless browser (like PhantomJS). The good thing about it, is that you can use selenium backend while you work on your script, and switch over to Phantomjs when itâ€™s done. This way, you will see what is going on while you do the hacking, and executes without opening any extra windows when you are done and want to use it.
